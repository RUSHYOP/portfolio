# Worklog

## 2026-09-14

- Linked repo to Vercel project `portfolio`; pulled production env into `.env.local`.
- Attempted to clone Railway MongoDB locally — connection stalls/resets on the Railway proxy port from this network (TCP connects, no MongoDB wire-protocol response). Parked; running against a local `mongo:latest` Docker container on port 27018 seeded from `data/*.json` instead.
- Fixed `QuoteSection` crash when a quote is empty (`useScroll` targeting an unmounted ref) by gating render before the hooks.
- Removed the circular theme-wipe transition (looked oval on wide viewports) and its dead CSS.
- Captured baseline screenshots of all 8 screens into `screenshots/`.
- Wrote `design.md` (architecture + visual system reference).
- Brainstormed the portfolio → portfolio + consulting redesign; decisions and chapter script in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-14-voyage-redesign-design.md`.

### Slices 1–2 built (branch `feat/voyage`, subagent-driven, Opus implementers + reviewers)
- 14 plan tasks executed with a fresh implementer and an independent reviewer per task; every Important finding fixed and re-reviewed before moving on.
- Foundation: `flightPath` (11-waypoint camera path, never-reverse invariant, chapter-aligned parameterisation), `voyageStore` + `useVoyage`, quality tiers with a once-per-load FPS probe, structured client logs → `/api/logs` → `logs/client.jsonl`.
- Scene: `SceneRoot` (single WebGL context), seeded `Starfield` (round sprites), seeded `WarpStreaks`, `EnergyOrb` star (FBM + fresnel + glow, world-space glow floor), `StillSky` fallback, Lenis bridge with native fallback and mount seed.
- DOM: `Telemetry`, `Letterbox`, `FlightRail`, `Dock` (ported ThreeUI proximity spring, MIT; idle-parking loop; dialog sheet with focus management), `CallToAction`, `Ignition`, `Launch`, `VoyageRoot`, `/voyage` route (noindex), `voyage.css`.
- Settings gained `heroHeadline` / `heroSubheadline` (data-driven hero copy; admin inputs are sub-project 2).
- Browser review at 1440×900 (tier `high`, probe ~121 fps) and 390×844 (tier `mid`): tuned star framing/scale/tone, fixed light-theme leaks (token pin + forced `data-theme="dark"` + attribute-rule shields), removed the legacy scroll hairline on `/voyage`, fixed the mobile hint/audio-pill collision, balanced the H1.
- Repo hygiene surfaced along the way: pre-existing `data.ts` type error fixed; `next lint` (removed in Next 16) replaced with a flat ESLint config; `Telemetry.tsx`/`telemetry.ts` case collision renamed.

### Next
- Merge `feat/voyage` after the whole-branch review; then plan slice 3 (Approach Vector + Jump) carrying forward the tuned constants (`STAR_SCALE_MAX = 2.4`, `LAUNCH_LOOK_OFFSET = (-28, 18, 0)`, `GLOW_MIN = 3.5`).
- Sub-project 2 (content model + CMS tabs) unblocks Services / Process / Case studies.
